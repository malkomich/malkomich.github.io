I always saw Maven like a dependency manager, something where you define the components you need to use, instead of downloading them and include in your project.

But I was wrong, Maven is something much higher than that.

The concepts on this series of 'Mastering the Maven Lifecycle', are easily adapted to Gradle. But I will keep the focus on Maven for this time.
