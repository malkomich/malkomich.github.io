# About

Software cooker, unhappy path driven developer and problem solver. Since I was a child I like to look for challenges to solve with software, and I always had clear my vocation of dedicate my life to the software engineering.

I dream on a day when we can get any answer for the humanity problems, and improve the live of people around the world, thanks to the power of software.

I believe that someday, the usage of AI solutions, empowered by scientific investigators, will lead us to significatively improve the humans life and reduce problems like cancer, not only identifying high-risk cases, but by giving us the opportunity to treat all health issues before the beginning.

In my second life...I love to travel, mainly to nature rich places. So I love the nature, losing myself around the mountains, and feeling nothing but the sound of the wind and the eagles flying over me. Big fan of Breaking Bad and war films. Beginner surfer & snowboarder. Married with an awesome an inspiring woman.
