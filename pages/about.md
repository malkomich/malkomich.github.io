# About

Software cooker, challenge driven developer and problem solver. Since I was a child I like to look for challenges to solve with software, and I always had clear my vocation of dedicate my life to the software engineering.

Focused on backend software, passionate about tech innovation, and with the soul of an entrepreneur.

I trust in software innovation as the tool that will empower scientists, to lead us to significantly improve the lives of humans and reduce all kinds of problems and diseases, to take us beyond what the human mind is able to get to know and understand.

In my second life ... I love to travel, mainly to places rich in nature. So I love nature, getting lost in the mountains and feeling nothing but the sound of the wind and the swaying of the trees above me. Big fan of Breaking Bad, Walking Dead and war films. Beginner surfer & snowboarder. Married with an awesome and inspiring woman.
